Hello,
first of all thanks a lot for your work with pypar.

Now my remark:
trying out testpypar.py with python 2.2, raw_receive(string)
doesn't work: the vanilla method is called instead of.

Looking your sources, in pypar.py:220 (about)

if type(x).__name__ == 'string':

doesn't work with (my) python 2.2 (GNU/Linux RH7.2 on i686),
where type(aString) == 'str'.

So I've done this simple workaround:

if type(x).__name__[0:3] == 'str':

(this should work for both python2.1 and python2.2)

HTH
Thanks again for your effort.

P.S.: perhaps I've mis-compiled my python2.2, but since
I've accepted all the defaults, I suppose that someone other
will find this very same issue.

P.S.: in my installation, pypar works with the latest LAM 6.5.6
