Hey Ole,

One more suggestion -- it's obvious in retrospect, but it would be useful 
to note in your install docs that you need to have Numeric, pypar, and 
python 2.3 (for the current version of Numeric, anyway) installed on all 
hosts.  It's what I *thought*, but trying without that set up produced no 
valuable diagnostic indicating why I was losing.  I would have saved a 
little time if I had gone ahead and done all of the installs as my first 
step...

Not a big deal, but it's always good to hear from the people currently 
enduring pain, since they always for get what the pain was after it's over :)

         -Doug
